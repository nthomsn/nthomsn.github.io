Tomatoes to rank the best received films on Netflix. I built
it because I
found myself constantly searching for third party reviews while browsing
for movies.</p><a href="http://topnetflix.net/list/combined/1">The website is live here.</a><h1 class="project-title">Gravity Simulation</h1><img src="img/gravity.png" class="pure-img project"><p>I wrote a gravity simulation code as part of a team in a Parallel Programming
course. Pictured is the initial and final states of our
simulation. Stars start more or less evenly spaced out, but form
interesting start clusters after a period of time. This is an example of
an emergent property created by the force of gravity between all pairs
of stars.

only shows you the title and description of each theme. You need to
follow each link to see what you actually care about -- how the theme
looks! I created AtomThemes.net after writing a script that gathers
together the images for every theme. The website
displays an image for each theme, making it much easier to find one
you like.</p></div></body></html>
